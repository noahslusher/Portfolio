# Noah Slusher's Professional Portfolio

### This repository will include some of my projects and will be updated regularly.

### This portfolio will have an about me section, my works section, and a contact section.

### This portfolio is meant to showcase some of the recent projects I have completed. It also shows my ability to create good looking websites that are functional and adapt to multiple screen sizes.
