                    Thanks for taking the time to check out my online portfolio! 
                    My name is Noah Slusher and I am originally from Las Vegas, NV.
                    I lived in Las Vegas for my entire life until I graduated high school.
                    Upon graduating, I pursued an undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX.
                    While there, I also completed a minor in applied physiology with the intention of going to medical school.
                    After I graduated, I realized I was not as passionate about pursuing medicine as I once had been, so I decided to pursue an alternative route.                        This route has led both of us to this webpage because I decided I wanted to pursue software development instead of medicine.
                    I could not be happier with the change I made because software development is truly fascinating to me and I can be a lifelong learner in this field.
                    <br>
                    Aside from academics, I love many things in life.
                    I am most passionate about the outdoors. 
                    I love the mountains and the beach and I love being active.
                    Photography is very important to me and I mostly capture nature scenes.
                    I like to stay active by lifting weights, hiking, skiing, snowboarding, and doing jiu jitsu.
                    This is a very small snippet about myself, don't be a stranger and feel free to contact me to learn more!
