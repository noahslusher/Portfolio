                    <p>
                        Thanks for taking the time to check out my online portfolio! 
                        My name is Noah Slusher and I am originally from Las Vegas, NV.
                        I lived in Las Vegas for my entire life until I graduated high school.
                        Upon graduating, I pursued an undergraduate degree in Biological Sciences at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX.
                        While there, I also completed a minor in applied physiology with the intention of going to medical school.
                        After I graduated, I realized I was not as passionate about pursuing medicine as I once had been, so I decided to pursue an alternative route.
                        This route has led both of us to this webpage because I decided I wanted to pursue software development instead of medicine.
                        I could not be happier with the change I made because software development is truly fascinating to me and I can be a lifelong learner in this field.
                        <br>
                        Aside from academics, I love many things in life.
                        I am most passionate about the outdoors. 
                        I love the mountains and the beach and I love being active.
                        Photography is very important to me and I mostly capture nature scenes.
                        I like to stay active by lifting weights, hiking, skiing, snowboarding, and doing jiu jitsu.
                        This is a very small snippet about myself, don't be a stranger and feel free to contact me to learn more!
